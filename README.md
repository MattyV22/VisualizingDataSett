# VisualizingDataSett
AWS Quicksight

Another project i followed through with Tech With Lucy on YT
Downloaded datasheets of 50,000 best selling amazon products, this came from Brightdata that gives you real life data to playwith
Next i stored this dataset within an s3 bucket, also included in this was the JSON file and inside that had the bucket name
next was to connect the s3 bucket wth quicksight and then to create the visulization
Sorting through all that data filter into catagories of brand, price, avaliabilty and more is a fun way of sorting out data, whats imposrtant, whats 
irrelevant and what is missed.
